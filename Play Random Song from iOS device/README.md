Play Random Song from iOS device
===========

Automates the playing of songs from your connected iOS device via iTunes. 

To use it do the following : 

1. Copy the code given into your AppleScript Editor on the Mac under Applications > Utilities > AppleScript Editor
2. Make the changes in the name of your playlist on the iOS device
3. Save as application on your hard drive somewhere 
4. Connect your iPhone/iPod/iPad to the computer via the USB cable. 
5. Double click on the finished application

The application launches for a few seconds, in that time it starts iTunes, connects iTunes & your iPhone, opens the playlist you specified in step 2 above, and starts playing a random song. To switch to another random song (in handsfree mode) just launch the application again. It should take considerably less time to run the second time, since the iTunes app is already launched on your Mac.
